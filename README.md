## 🚀 About This Project

This repository contains the **Admin Dashboard** for the "IGNITE 2025" event management platform. It's a secure, single-page web application designed for event organizers to manage attendee registrations, view event statistics, and generate tickets manually.

Built with **Vanilla JavaScript** and **Tailwind CSS**, it provides a real-time interface connected to the project's **Cloud Firestore** database. Access is restricted via Firebase Email/Password Authentication, ensuring only authorized administrators can view and manage event data.

This dashboard interacts with data generated by the separate **Public Booking Site** and prepares data for the **Ticket Verifier** application.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* **Secure Admin Login:** Access is protected using **Firebase Email/Password Authentication**. Unauthorized users cannot view or interact with the dashboard.
* **Real-time Data:** Uses **Firestore `onSnapshot` listeners** to display live updates of pending and approved registrations as they happen.
* **Registration Approval Workflow:** Admins can view details of pending registrations (from the public site) and approve them with a single click. Approval securely moves the attendee record from the `pending_registrations` collection to the `approved_registrations` collection using Firestore rules.
* **Attendee Management:** Displays a sortable list of all attendees (pending and approved) with key details.
* **Manual Ticket Generation:** Allows admins to manually add attendees (e.g., for cash payments) directly into the `approved_registrations` collection.
* **Ticket & Receipt Viewing/Downloading:** Admins can view and download the official Ticket (with QR code) and Payment Receipt (in JPG or combined PDF format) for any attendee, generated on-the-fly using `qrious`, `html2canvas`, and `jsPDF`.
* **Data Export:** Provides functionality to download the entire attendee log (pending + approved) as a formatted PDF or JPG report using `jsPDF-AutoTable` and `html2canvas`.
* **Dashboard Statistics:** Displays key metrics like total pending approvals, total approved tickets, and registrations made today.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

<details><summary>This project utilizes the following technologies and services:</summary>

* [**HTML5**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5): Standard markup language for creating web pages.

## 🔐 Security Model

Security is paramount for this admin dashboard. Access control is enforced at multiple levels:

1.  **Client-Side Login:** The entire application UI is hidden until a user successfully authenticates using a pre-defined admin email and password via **Firebase Authentication**.
2.  **Firestore Security Rules:** The backend database access is governed by strict `FIRESTORE.rules`. These rules ensure:
    * Only authenticated users whose **UID matches the designated admin UID** can `read`, `create`, `update`, or `delete` data in the relevant collections (`pending_registrations`, `approved_registrations`).
    * Public users (even anonymous ones from the booking site) **cannot** read admin data or approve registrations themselves.
    * The rules specify exactly which fields can be written or updated, preventing unauthorized data modification. *(See `FIRESTORE.rules` file for details)*.

---

## 🧰 Getting Started

To get this admin panel running locally.

### 📋 Prerequisites

* You **must** have already set up the Firebase project for the main booking site.
* **Firebase Project:** Access to your existing Firebase project console.
* **Admin Account:** You need to have created an Email/Password user in **Firebase Authentication** and obtained their **User UID**.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Optional: for using a local development server)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repo**
    *(Replace with your actual GitHub username and repo name if different)*
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/suyogsontakke/ignite-2025-admin.git](https://github.com/suyogsontakke/ignite-2025-admin.git)
    cd ignite-2025-admin
    ```

2.  **Configure Firestore Rules**
    * Go to your **Firebase Console** -> **Firestore Database** -> **Rules**.
    * Paste the contents of the `FIRESTORE.rules` file from this repository.
    * **Crucially:** Find the lines containing `YOUR_ADMIN_UID_HERE` and replace it with the actual User UID of the admin account you created in Firebase Authentication.
    * **Publish** the rules.

3.  **Configure `admin.html`**
    * Open `admin.html` in a code editor.
    * Find the `<script type="module">` section.
    * **Firebase Config:** Locate the `firebaseConfig` object and ensure it matches the config from your Firebase project settings.
    * **Admin Email:** Find the `handleLogin` function. Set the `email` variable to the email address of the admin account you created in Firebase Authentication.
        ```javascript
        // --- !!! SET YOUR ADMIN EMAIL HERE !!! ---
        const email = "your-admin-email@example.com";
        ```

### ▶️ Run Locally

* **Simple Method:** Open the `admin.html` file directly in your web browser. You will be prompted to log in.
* **Recommended Method (using a local server):**
    ```bash
    npx live-server
    # OR if installed globally:
    # live-server
    ```
    Navigate to the local URL provided (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080`).

---

## 🔒 Environment Variables

Unlike the public booking site, this admin panel requires fewer external keys configured directly in the code, as most access relies on the authenticated admin user.

* **Firebase Configuration Object:** Found within the `<script type="module">` in `admin.html`. Must match your Firebase project settings.
* **Admin Email Address:** Hardcoded within the `handleLogin` function in `admin.html`. This must match an existing Email/Password user in your Firebase Authentication.

**Note:** The admin password is *not* stored in the code; it is entered by the user and verified by Firebase Authentication directly.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

Deploy this static HTML file similarly to the public booking site. However, ensure access is restricted if possible, as this is an internal tool.

* **Firebase Hosting:** Recommended, as it integrates well. You can potentially add additional access controls via Firebase features or Cloud Functions if needed later.
* **Vercel/Netlify:** Possible, but ensure the site is not easily discoverable or indexed by search engines. Consider password-protecting the deployment via your hosting provider's settings if available.
* **Internal Server:** Deploying on a private network or server is also an option.

```bash
# Example Firebase Deployment
firebase deploy --only hosting
